      <p>The three-toed sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals (also known as “three-fingered” sloths)</p>
      <p>Famously slow-moving, a sloth travels at an average speed of 0.24 km/h. Three-toed sloths are about the size of a small dog or a large cat, with the head and body having a combined length around 45 cm and a weight of 3.5–4.5 kg. Unlike the two-toed sloths, they also have short tails of 6–7 cm, and they have three clawed toes on each limb.</p>
      <p>All sloths have three digits on their hindlimbs; the difference is found in the number of digits on the forelimbs; thus they are sometimes referred to as three-fingered sloths.</p>
